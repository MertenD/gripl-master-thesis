  abstract = {The European Parliament adopted the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR, EU 2016/679) which revolutionized the legislative framework for personal data protection within the European Union. The GDPR mandates organizations to shift from a passive approach, relying on minimum security measures outlined in the 1994 EU Directive, to a proactive accountability-based approach. Organizations are expected to implement verification systems, foster continuous improvement, and follow principles such as privacy by design and privacy by default. The latter principle emphasizes incorporating privacy considerations throughout the entire engineering process. The challenge for organizations lies in effectively auditing their compliance with the GDPR. This study proposes a structured approach based on business process modeling to aid in GDPR compliance. It involves identifying crucial compliance points for the GDPR. A case study is presented where the method is applied to a purchase of a health insurance policy process in the context of the Secure Safe Apulia project.},

  abstract = {Complying with data protection regulations is an essential duty for organizations since violating them would lead to monetary penalties from authorities. In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) defines personal data and requirements for dealing with this type of data. Hence, organizations must identify business activities that deal with personal data to establish measures to fulfill these requirements. Especially for large organizations, a manual identification can be labor-intensive and error-prone. However, textual business process descriptions, such as work instructions, provide valuable insights into the data used in organizations. Therefore, we propose a first approach to automatically identify GDPR-critical tasks in textual business process descriptions. More specifically, we use a supervised machine learning algorithm to automatically identify whether a task deals with personal data or not. A first evaluation of our approach with a dataset of 37 process descriptions containing 509 activities demonstrates that our approach generates satisfactory results.},

  abstract = {The general data protection regulation (GDPR) provides European individuals with a regulatory framework for personal data protection and privacy. Compliance with this regulation represents an essential challenge for organisations that store, transmit, and process personal data. Millionaire fines are imposed by European protection authorities due to non-compliance. Currently, non-automated solutions are applied in organisations to carry out regulatory compliance, and therefore expensive manual implementation and audits are necessary to ensure GDPR compliance. To avoid these drawbacks, this paper presents a data model and a business process model as a first step towards designing automated mechanisms for implementing the GDPR. Furthermore, the proposed models are employed to support business process simulation (BPS), which includes aspects of performance, cost, and scalability, for evaluating the resource human impact and the execution time that our proposal can have in organisations. These factors would facilitate informed decision-making by the data controller regarding the resources and the degree of GDPR compliance, supporting data controller decisions regarding determining the necessary types of resources to achieve a suitable level of compliance and to obtain the degree of GDPR compliance. Given the large number of legal articles on the GDPR and owing to space limitation herein, we focus on Articles 33 and 34 regarding notification and communication of a personal data breach.},

  abstract = {This article explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to determine if online privacy policies comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) since privacy policies do not always adhere to all relevant GDPR requirements. This paper proposes a method to classify privacy policies as compliant or not with a single duty within Article 13 (2)(b) of the GDPR, which mandates that data subjects be informed of their right to rectification or erasure of personal data. To address that, we employed several LLMs such as BERT-base-uncased, roBERTa-base, distilBERT-base-uncased, t5-base, and ERNIE-2.0-base-en on a dataset built by the authors from European websites domains. Moreover, once the dataset was built, a legal expert from our research team manually classified a set of privacy policies to perform the contextual sentence similarity task. As the final step, we employed a set of unseen privacy policies to test models, obtaining interesting results demonstrating moderate accuracy in identifying compliant phrases using these thresholds. Future research could include expanding the analysis to encompass other GDPR requirements and refining the models.},

  abstract = {The widespread use of mobile applications has driven the growth of the industry, with companies relying heavily on user data for services like targeted advertising and personalized offerings. In this context, privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) playa crucial role. One of the GDPR requirements is the maintenance of a Record of Processing Activities (RoPA) by companies. RoPA encompasses various details, including the description of data processing activities, their purposes, types of data involved, and other relevant external entities. Small app-developing companies face challenges in meeting such compliance requirements due to resource limitations and tight timelines. To aid these developers and prevent fines, we propose a method to generate segments of RoPA from user-authored usage scenarios using large language models (LLMs). Our method employs few-shot learning with G PT-3.S Turbo to summarize usage scenarios and generate RoPA segments. We evaluate different factors that can affect few-shot learning performance consistency for our summarization task, including the number of examples in few-shot learning prompts, repetition, and order permutation of examples in the prompts. Our findings highlight the significant influence of the number of examples in prompts on summarization F1 scores, while demonstrating negligible variability in F1 scores across multiple prompt repetitions. Our prompts achieve successful summarization of processing activities with an average 70 \% ROUGE-L F1 score. Finally, we discuss avenues for improving results through manual evaluation of the generated summaries.},

  abstract = {This study investigates the capabilities of open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating GDPR compliance documentation, specifically in generating data categories—types of personal data (e.g., names, email addresses)—for processing activity records, a document required by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). By comparing four state-of-the-art open-source models with the closed-source GPT-4, we evaluate their performance using benchmarks tailored to GDPR tasks: a multiple-choice benchmark testing contextual knowledge (evaluated by accuracy and F1 score) and a generation benchmark evaluating structured data generation. In addition, we conduct four experiments using context-augmenting techniques such as few-shot prompting and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We evaluate these on performance metrics such as latency, structure, grammar, validity, and contextual understanding. Our results show that open-source models, particularly Qwen2-7B, achieve performance comparable to GPT-4, demonstrating their potential as cost-effective and privacy-preserving alternatives. Context-augmenting techniques show mixed results, with RAG improving performance for known categories but struggling with categories not contained in the knowledge base. Open-source models excel at structured legal tasks, although challenges remain in handling ambiguous legal language and unstructured scenarios. These findings underscore the viability of open-source models for GDPR compliance, while highlighting the need for fine-tuning and improved context augmentation to address complex use cases.},

  abstract = {Process-Driven Applications flourish through the interaction between an executable BPMN process model, human tasks, and external software services. All these components operate on shared process data, so it is even more important to check the correct data flow. However, data flow is in most cases not explicitly defined but hidden in model elements, form declarations, and program code. This paper elaborates on data-flow anomalies acting as indicators for potential errors and how such anomalies can be uncovered despite implicit and hidden data-flow definitions. By considering an integrated view, it goes beyond other approaches which are restricted to separate data-flow analysis of either process model or source code. The main idea is to merge call graphs representing programmed services into a control-flow representation of the process model, to label the resulting graph with associated data operations, and to detect anomalies in that labeled graph using a dedicated data-flow analysis. The applicability of the solution is demonstrated by a prototype designed for the Camunda BPM platform.},
